Analog distortion is especially popular with guitar players.
Some amplifiers are famous for their signature saturating distortion and distortion effect pedals are found designed with a vast variety of built-in distortion circuits.
Typically these circuits are built around either vacuum tubes, transistor stages, diode clippers or op-amps.
Analysis of electrical designs making use of these components yields that they have non-linear transfer behaviour in common.
These non-linear system transfer characteristics cause a more or less harmonically distorted output depending how the circuit is driven.
Digitally emulating these circuits means modelling this non-linear behaviour as best possible with a digital processor.
Numerous techniques have been brought up in research over the years and
in chapter 2 of Vanilla Processors we take a look at some of the more popular approaches to digitally emulate analog style distortion effects.

== The effect profile

The distortion effect class we will be taking a closer look at designing is mostly referred to as waveshapers or saturators.
Both types of signal processing are in the family of effects that introduce amplitude distortion or harmonic distortion similarly to what was achieved with bit-depth reduction in the bitcrusher, see chapter 1 of this book.
The name waveshaping stems from the fact that the input signal is "shaped" by the effect and the output waveform's amplitude appears distorted at the output when viewed through an oscilloscope, hence the classification as amplitude distortion.
The term saturator is derived from the impact the effect has when the output signal is compared to the input in the frequency domain.
When driving the system with a pure sine wave tone and analysing the output in an FFT analyser, the output appears saturated with overtones, hence the classification as harmonic distortion.
Depending on the waveshaping applied, the overtones can be odd- or even numbered multiples of the fundamental tone or both.
Even though this effect carries several names, they refer to the same thing in this particular case.

NOTE: When describing distortion in an abstract way, we can say distortion happens in a system that modulates an input signal's amplitude non-linearly (i.e. mapping the input- to the output amplitude differently depending on the input amplitude).
This is what a saturator does but also what happens when you use compressors, limiters or ring modulators on your inputs.

=== Control parameters

Distortion effects are often parametrised with input and output drive and ways to shape the input- and output tone before and after the non-linearity.
The pre- and post attenuation factors are used to drive the distortion characteristic and to tame the output amplitude of the distorted signal whereas the pre- and post filtering can help dial in the harmonic content that is processed and that is obtained after processing in the non-linear system.
This user interface setup is typically used in one or the other was for many guitar distortion pedals.
One example of emulating saturation is software is the native saturator plugin in Ableton Live which implements these controls wile adding others. Check out this effect interface by watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9CqQQrW3xA[this video].

== The theory behind the effect

Let's take a closer look at some of the theory surrounding digital, analog distortion which is also called virtual analog distortion.

=== Circuit Analysis

Virtual analog style effects aim to model the characteristic sound of analog circuitry.
Generally, distortion circuits consist of stem:[n] linear systems (aka filters) that surround a non-linearity.
Both designs with or without feedback loops are possible, see the definition of the https://youtu.be/7Npx0eaSxow?t=5m6s[delay-free loop].
In order to derive a digital model representation of the original circuit there exists an array of continuous domain tools that can be applied.
The two steps necessary for emulating the original are modelling the circuit in continuous time using tools such as https://youtu.be/7Npx0eaSxow?t=14m20s[nodal analysis] (i.e Kirchhoffs laws) or https://youtu.be/7Npx0eaSxow?t=26m31s[state-space analysis] and then transforming these models from continuous into discrete time using a transformation such as the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_transform[Bilinear Transform] or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_differentiation_formula[Backwards Differentiation].
In the next chapter we will focus on some simple circuit analysis of both linear and non linear components and see how we can derive a memoryless saturating transfer function to get quite close to approximating the non-linearity.
We will use some simple pre- and post-filtering to surround our non-linearity with which to model the linear part of the system.
No matter what technique is chosen to model the analog circuit digitally, the focus should also be directed to finding a representation that is computationally efficient enough for real-time use without stressing the processing CPU too much.

=== VA distortion model types

The types of virtual analog distortion models can be roughly split into three categories.

  . Waveshaping with saturating (clipping) functions: using static functions that approximate analog non-linearities and surrounding them with digital filters to shape the distortion tone to taste
  . Approximating behaviour of a circuit block model (as modelled https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation[Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)]}): using Volterra expansion or convolution for example, implemented with or without memory, with or without operating point bias
  . Realtime simulation of the circuit block ODEs with numerical (iterative) solvers (implicit, explicit) using solvers like Newton, Forward Euler, Runge-Kutta etc.

As mentioned in the last chapter, we will approach distortion emulation using the first technique described.
The second and third approach are more advance and will be beyond the scope of this discussion.
These advanced approaches are taken to make the model capable of emulating the analog original even more closely using system modelling techniques that are based on ordinary differential equations.
ODE solving at realtime is computationally expensive and a difficult problem to solve efficiently in realtime which is why we will not consider these techniques here.

NOTE: For the interested, the next two sections take a high-level look at some topics included in more sophisticated models such as the methods (2) and (3).
Feel free to skip ahead if you want.
Also, get to know more about advanced circuit modelling by viewing this great https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Npx0eaSxow[DAFX17 workshop] by Dave Berners.

=== Modelling memoryless vs. with memory

The standard way of implementing digital distortion is by using a static non-linearity (see clipping functions discussed later).
These functions are often tabulated (i.e. in a lookup table) and interpolated for efficiency or designed in the form of polynomial expressions, using a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_interpolation[spline-fit] for example.
Some polynomials, such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials[Chebyshev-Polynomials].
and others are used to control the harmonic distortion caused by the effect, as discussed in this https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/5959/add-odd-even-harmonics-to-signal[thread at dspstackexchange].
Using a model without memory (aka. static) means that the output at each sample stem:[n] in time is not dependent on the state of the system at sample step stem:[n-1].
In real analog non-linear systems this is never the case though.
These systems have a behaviour at time stem:[t] which is influenced by it's states at that point in time.
Memory is implemented in a digital emulation by keeping track of the systems states, in other words considering the states at sample step stem:[n-1] for calculation of the output stem:[y[n]].

=== Modelling with operating point bias

A large amount of analog distortion circuits consist of a linear part connected to a non-linear part.
For the linear part of the system it is always possible to https://youtu.be/7Npx0eaSxow?t=8m27s[derive a linear equation] to describe the transfer characteristic.
This characteristic depends on the components used in the circuit, the inputs over time and on the system state as a function of time if the circuit contains https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_reactance[reactances].
Assuming we model the non-linearity as memoryless function of the input, then in order to emulate the system, the intersection of both equations should be found for sample step stem:[n].
Finding the intersection of the linear load line with the non-linear function is called operating point bias or loading.
Once the operating point is set the model can be solved numerically for the current sample step.

=== Intermodulation

Aside from harmonic distortion as seen when driving a saturator with a pure sine wave, non-linearities produce https://science-of-sound.net/2016/09/understanding-intermodulation-distortion/[frequency intermodulations] as soon as they are processing complex input waveforms consisting of the sum of more than one frequency.
The location of the harmonic content added in the audio band can be calculated methodologically and becomes more and more complex with the order of frequencies in input signal.
Miller Puckette takes a look at a simple example of https://books.google.ch/books?id=TCtnWBfyhbwC&pg=PA130&lpg=PA130&dq=miller+puckette+intermodulation&source=bl&ots=oHB_srVuzJ&sig=7Uo82fUYnrUJuGC2VLkhWcw851w&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjgxdb4vKvcAhXEiCwKHR3vBZkQ6AEIeDAS#v=onepage&q=miller%20puckette%20intermodulation&f=false[analysing intermodulation for a non-linearity] in his book on the theory of electronic music.
Sometimes intermodulation distortion is desired, for example when playing power chords through overdrive as it can cause pleasing sub-harmonic content, other times it is unwanted, for example when mixing music, as it can cause glitches in the mix such as audible amplitude batting and raised noise floors.
What intermodulation content to retain and what of it to dismiss when modelling VA systems comes down to a decision in the design process.

=== Antialiasing

Any type of https://www.howtogeek.com/64096/htg-explains-how-do-guitar-distortion-and-overdrive-work/[distortion] on an input signal causes bandwidth expansion in the frequency domain.
At regular audio sample rates (i.e 44.1kHz) this will lead to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing[frequency reflections] in the audio band.
These reflections - called foldover or https://science-of-sound.net/2016/06/oversampling-distortion-effects/[aliases] in the frequency domain - can be audible (especially for high frequencies) and to make things worse, aliases can intermodulate with other frequency content in feedback loops.
While creating aliases is the trademark of effects such as the bitcrusher, aliasing is mostly unwanted in high quality digital distortion.
The straight forward approach to remove aliases is to https://www.oblique-audio.com/technique/oversampling[oversample] by a factor stem:[n] , then process the non-linearity and down-sample (filter) again before outputting.
Depending on stem:[n], this can become computationally expensive though at high values.

=== Infinite Linear Oversampling (ILO)

ILO is an attempt at lowering the stress linear oversampling puts on the digital processor by calculating stem:[n] times more often in order to obtain all the virtual, upsampled sample values between two sample steps.
The technique substantially lowers aliases by applying a trick that we can approach rather geometrically.
Before doing this, let me take a moment to focus on aliasing in a less mathematical fashion.
Aliasing in analog-digital conversion happens if we take an analog signal and sample it (i.e. modulate it) and want to convert the digital, sampled signal back into an analog one but can no longer exactly guarantee what we convert back is exactly the same as the original.
Picture sampling a sine running at high frequency by hand using a low sample rate.
You could do this by drawing points into a graph over sample time.
If you convert back to the analog world by drawing a line that connects your dots in the graph and you have made sure to break the Nyquist law with the sample frequency chosen you will end up with several ways to draw a sine wave through your points.
The conversion back to continuous time now has an ambiguous solution: it creates an alias in the frequency domain.
Turning the attention back to waveshaping, we can find the same thing happening when processing our samples with a non-linear clipping function.
If we take a hard-clipper for example, and look at two output samples that were processed where one was not distorted and the next was, who is to say that for the continuous input the clipping actually happened at the exactly the sampling step and not in-between these steps?
In other words there is a high chance that if we compare running an analog signal through a clipping circuit and do the same with our digital version of the clipper, the latter will result in an inaccurate representation of the former in the sense of when exactly clipping actually started.
This situation quickly makes sense when drawing some examples onto paper.
In the end we have an ambiguity again which leads to aliasing when distorting.
Linear oversampling reduces inaccuracy by adding more samples in between steps to prevent aliases from happening, but the cost is that the processing effort is multiplied by the order of the oversampling factor.
ILO uses a trick to avoid high inaccuracy (and a lot of aliases) while not adding stem:[n] time more processing load, which is to calculate the sum of an infinite amount of samples between two sampling steps and then average over the amount of samples between the two.
This is no longer linear oversampling by the order of stem:[n], but by an infinite order.
The actual trick is how to obtain infinite upsampled values in a digital realm.
This can be done by integrating over the actual clipping function.
Given inputs stem:[x[n-1]] and stem:[x[n]], we calculate both the integrals of our clipping function over an interval of stem:[[0;n-1]] and stem:[[0;n]].
When we subtract them from each other we arrive at the sum of infinite samples (or slices if you so want) between step stem:[n-1] and stem:[n].
Now what is left to do is to average over the amount of samples given by subtracting stem:[x[n-1]] from stem:[x[n]] to get our approximated input signal after oversampling.
This is done by dividing the sum of integrals by the amount of events between both samples.
It turns out that by using this trick you save on CPU load while getting very far in removing aliasing from the effected output.
ILO was developed by a group of employees at Native Instruments and https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308020367_Reducing_The_Aliasing_Of_Nonlinear_Waveshaping_Using_Continuous-Time_Convolution[presented at DAFX16].
You can find a non-academical approach to ILO in the https://www.native-instruments.com/de/reaktor-community/reaktor-user-library/entry/show/10381/[Reaktor user library].

NOTE: When summing up ILO in a nutshell, what we are doing is integrating our clipping function for two successive input values to get all possible sample slices between the two samples and then https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus#Mean_value_theorem[differentiating] (averaging) over the sampling period in time between them to end up in our linearly oversampled result without having to do calculations in the CPU at the factor of stem:[n] times.
Another way of putting this is, we move from a discrete time signal to a continuous signal using integration, then run the signal through the clipper and move it back to discrete time with differentiation.

== Designing the effect

Now that we have taken a closer look at the theory the effect is based on we can move on to designing our own analog style saturator effect.

TIP: This book will not drop heaps of formulas on you, the reader. With this book, we have published some math sheets that sum up the most relevant calculations for you to keep this book from becoming cluttered.
If you are interested in designng and building your own effect implementation, I suggest you study the mathemagics sheet and the build book for this effect.
Both are distributed with each chapter and maintained in our github repository.

We will take the following steps to develop our design:

. circuit analysis to arrive at a continuous system model that can be approximated in a static non-linear clipping function
. simulate the model in matlab
. implement and run the model in real-time using FAUST

=== Analysing the Boss DS-1 diode limiter

The https://www.boss.info/us/products/ds-1/[Boss DS-1] pedal is a classic guitar distortion effect.
The circuit consists of a number of linear subsystems surrounding two main non-linearities, an non-inverting op-amp gain-stage and a diode-limiter that follows it.
The non-linear systems are designed to boost and load the non-linearities and the tone stack is located after the distortion stages to sculpt the tone which is output by it.
In this example I am going to focus the analysis of the diode-limiter only as shown in the image below.

.The Boss DS-1 diode clipper circuit
image::bs-ds1-diode-clipper.png[The Boss DS-1 diode clipper circuit]

The limiter circuit is made up of a RC low pass filter with a diode clipper across the capacitor.
We can look up a model representation for the pn diode which can be used to calculate it's output current:

[stem]
++++
I_d=I_s(e^{V/V_t}-1)
++++

stem:[V_s] is the reverse saturation current and stem:[V_t] is the thermal voltage.
Typically these system parameters can be extracted by measurement in the circuit.
With the help of Kirchhoff's Laws we can arrive at an ODE that models the limiter:

[stem]
++++
\frac{\partial V_o}{\partial t} = \frac{V_i-V_o}{RC}-2\frac{I_s}{C}(\sinh (V_o/V_t))
++++

Since we can see a term in the nominator of the filter that changes with voltage (stem:[V_i-V_o]) this model has memory, since the filter characteristic changes depending on the in- and output voltage.
For simplicity, we can approximate statically, by setting the change in the voltage term to stem:[0] over time.
What we have arrived at now is a model with an input-output characteristic that can be compared to analytic approximations based on hyperbolic tangent and arctangent functions.
One measure to take at this point would be to run the model in a simulation to plot the transfer behaviour and then think about how to best approximate it.
Based on this investigation, we could decide if we want to choose to design a tabulated and interpolated approximation of the transfer function (can get very close to the actual transfer curve) or if we want to go with a general formula to approximate the characteristic.
If we decide to go ahead with this alternative we can determine following approximation

[stem]
++++
\frac{x}{(1+|x|^{n})^{1/n}}
++++

that matches the original quite well for stem:[n=2.5].
stem:[n] can be used to further tweak this static non-linearity to taste.
We can now implement this clipping function in our saturator.
If you want to dive deeper into the circuit analysis, check out the https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9903/44e66aa3851e90fc7a825f7481a33be21ecf.pdf[paper I have based this section on].

==== Other static non-linear clipping models

For your interest, here's a list of other popular clipping functions without explicitly explaining how they were derived:

Examples of saturating clipping functions::
  * hyperbolic tangent: stem:[f(x)=\tanh(x)]
  * inverse tangent (arctan): stem:[f(x)=\tan^{-1}(x)]
  * numerical approx. of hyperbolic tangent: stem:[f(x)=\frac{1}{(1+|x|^n)^{1/n}}]
  * hard clipping: stem:[f(x)=\begin{cases} x, & |x|\leq a \\ a, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}]
  * Sullivan cubic soft-clipper: stem:[f(x)=\begin{cases} -\frac{2}{3}, & |x|\leq -1 \\ x-\frac{x^3}{3}, & -1\leq x \leq 1 \\ \frac{2}{3}, & |x|\geq 1 \end{cases}]

These could be used for additional presets used in the saturator and if you take a closer look at these functions, you will probably have encountered them built into some audio plugins.

=== Matlab model simulation

Matlab scripts can be utilised to simulate our model and plot some results to graphs we can use to check if it works as expected.
We'll define three plots that are of interest:

  * plot of the approximation of the non-linear, hyperbolic clipping function
  * a pure input sine-wave compared to one that has been amplified and processed by the saturator
  * the frequency spectrum of a pure sine-wave input compared to the spectrum of an amplified sine-wave which has been saturated

In oder to run our simulation in matlab we need to set up some input data to work with. The following table gives details on how we can define some input data.

|===

With the input data set up properly we can move on to generating our simulation plots.
First, let's plot the non-linear clipping function as output voltage stem:[V_o] over input voltage stem:[V_i].
The plot uses the input voltages `v_i` and processes them with the clipping model.
You can see that the plot clearly shows the non-linear characteristic of the diode-clipper we are approximating.

.The diode limiter clipping function
image::diode_limiter_matlab.png[The diode limiter clipping function]

In oder to get an idea of what the clipper does when being run on audio samples we can compare a pure sine wave with one that has been processed by the saturating function.
In the following plot you can see the unprocessed input signal `x` on the left side.
The right side of the image depicts a plot of the amplified input `4*x` processed by the diode-clipper model.
The high amplification was chosen so that you can get a clear picture of how the saturator works on a wave-form.

.Pure sine waveform vs. a 4-times amplified, clipped sine waveform
image::sine-vs-distorted-sine.png[Pure sine waveform vs. an 4-times amplified, clipped sine waveform]

For the final plot we can lower `af` to stem:[1.5].
As you can see in the next image on the right-hand side, even at a low amplification, the saturator clearly adds new harmonic content in the form of odd harmonic overtones (i.e. at 3,5,7,... times the fundamental frequency).
For better reference the magnitude spectrum of the unprocessed sine-wave is shown on the left-hand side.

TIP: All symmetrical non-linearities such as the diode-clipper cause the even harmonics to be cancelled out due to the relationship of phase in the overtones added by modelling the two inverted diodes in the original distortion circuit.
All even order harmonics are always stem:[180°] apart in the time domain, thus inverted which leads to them cancelling each other.
The asymmetrical distortion caused by using only one diode instead of two in the circuit we emulated would actually cause the even-order harmonic content to re-appear.
If we wanted to add even-order harmonics while sticking to our symmetrical diode-clipper design, we would have to offset the input signal, making the input asymmetrical.
This is called applying a DC-offset to the input.
When using the symmetrical clipper and DC offset applied at the input before processing the non-linearity the output will be asymmetrically shaped in effect and even-order harmonics will be re-introduced.

image::pure-vs-clipped-dft.png[Magnitude spectrum of a pure and a clipped sine wave, sine running at 400Hz and amplified by 1.5 before being clipped]

The octave simulation has shown that the model of the DS-1 diode clipper is saturating audio input in the way that we expected.
What remains to be done now, is to implement a real-time model for it.
This will be discussed in the next chapter.

TIP: All octave scripts that were used to generate these plots are available for download in our https://github.com/bfabricius?tab=repositories[open source repositories].
TODO: Change this link.

=== FAUST real-time model implementation

http://faust.grame.fr/[FAUST] is a functional programming language intended to design high-level signal processor with a block diagram approach in mind.
We will use it to develop a model implementation of our saturator that can be run at real-time.
There is an https://ccrma.stanford.edu/realsimple/faust_strings/Cubic_Nonlinear_Distortion.html[example of cubic non-linear distortion] in the FAUST distribution effect example libraries that we can inspect to get started with.

Implementing the block diagram for the clipper is straight forward.
The distortion path is created inside a bypass architecture so that the effect can switch between a clean and an effect path by toggling a value.

.Overview of the DS-1 clipper block diagram
image::TopLevelClipperDiagram.png[Overview of the DS-1 clipper blockdiagram]

The clean path will not effect the input while the effect will work when bypass is switched off.
The effect path consists of a series of blocks.
First we apply a pre-gain to the signal, the gain can be controlled with the input parameter called "drive".
Then we apply a DC-offset to the amplified signal.
The amount of offset is controlled by the "offset" parameter.
Both parameters, "drive" and "offset", can be set with slider UI elements.
We will make sure that we smooth the stepped parameters with a simple low pass filter so that there are no crackling glitches caused by discrete parameter steps.
After offsetting the signal, we pass it through a hard clipping stage, to prevent samples from being outside the normalised value range and then pass the samples into the actual waveshaping non-linearity of the clipper labelled "ds1clp" in the diagram.

.Exponential scale and range of the pregain block, the x-axis describes the range of the raw "drive" slider value inputs
image::pregain-scaling.png[Exponential scale and range of the pregain block, the x-axis describes the range of the raw "drive" slider value inputs]

You can see the "offset" parameter clearly in the diagram, the "drive" is located in the pre-gain block where we perform some scaling of the raw slider value after smoothing the parameter to transform the value into a more extreme, exponential range.
Selecting parameter range transformations is an experimental process and can be done while testing the effect in development.

.The main effect block diagram of the DS-1 clipper
image::ClipperOverviewDiagram.png[The main effect block diagram of the DS-1 clipper]

The distorted samples are finally passed to a DC-blocker filter stage.
This filter blocks any low frequency energy created by existing DC-offset applied to the input.
The offset could have been applied by the offset parameter in the clipper effect or the input signal could already contain offset from the get go.
Since the low-frequency energy does not add to the timbre of the output and causes the output to peak higher it is not a bad idea to install this filter before the output and to keep it active always.
The DC filter has an order of stem:[1] and a near flat phase response except for a slight peak of around stem:[35°] close to DC. 3dB Point???

NOTE:
Refer to the mathemagics sheet for this chapter available in our repositories for details on all the componennts used in this FAUST diagram design.

=== Implementing Infinite Linear Oversampling

For a basic implementation of ILO we will have to add some additional signal processing into our effect design.
We will build on our basic implementation and add to it the ILO method.
ILO works by virtually moving back from the discrete into the continuous time domain, then processing the non-linearity and finally moving back to discrete time before sending out audio.
As already discussed in the theoretical part of this article on ILO, we will need to work with integrating our waveshaper over a fixed interval for two input samples stem:[n] and stem:[n-1], then form the difference between them before differentiating back into discrete time.
Following math will accomplish this for us:

[stem]
++++
y(n)=\frac{\int clip(n)-\int clip(n-1)}{clip(n)-clip(n-1)}
++++

In order to get this to work, we will have to know the integral of our clipping function.
A closer look at our approximation for the DS-1 clipper stem:[ds1clip] reveals that this clipping function is actually not trivial to integrate and the solution of the indefinite integral would be complex to implement computationally.
For arguments sake, we will therefore use a different waveshaping function, one that has similar characteristics to stem:[ds1clip], is not as closely an approximation of the actual clipping circuit we analysed but far easier to integrate.
The referred function is the hyperbolic tangent. It's plot resembles stem:[ds1clip] to a certain extent and was mentioned earlier in the list of typical waveshaping functions.

.Plot of the hyperbolic tangent waveshaping function
image::hyperbolic-tangent-plot.png[Plot of the hyperbolic tangent waveshaping function]

Now, lets integrate stem:[y(x)=\tanh(x)]

[stem]
++++
\int \tanh(x) dx = \log(\frac{1}{2}(e^{-x}+e^x))
++++

To experience the result of using the entire effect with ILO we will now assume that stem:[ds1clip(n)=\tanh(n)].

.The integration of ds1clp results in a processor called ds1clp_int
image::ds1clip-integral.png[The integration of ds1clp results in a processor called ds1clp_int]

With this assumption made, ILO can now be added to our original design.
Following image shows a block diagram for ds1clp_ilo, the ds-1 clipper with infinite linear oversampling applied to it.

.FAUST diagram showing the ds1clp_ilo waveshaping processor with ILO being applied
image::ds1clipper-with-ilo.png[FAUST diagram showing the ds1clp_integral waveshaping processor with ILO]

The block in the nominator branch processes the difference of integrals of the clipper and the denominator branch calculates the difference between samples stem:[n] and stem:[n-1] run through ds1clp.
The division of both branches completes our ILO algorithm.

.The ds1clp_ilo_integraldiff processor

.The ds1clp_ilo_diff processor
image::ds1clp-ilo-diff.png[The ds1clp_ilo_diff processor]

To prevent unwanted warping we need to pay attention that the denominator difference does not equal stem:[0] as we would be performing a division by stem:[0] in that case.
This can be done by checking if the difference is lower than a threshold, a small constant value like stem:[0.00001] for example.

.Check to prevent warping by 0-division
image::compare-against-warp.png[Check to prevent warping by 0-division]

Should this be the case we simply output a sample processed by the non-antialiased version of the waveshaping function.
The following image contains the top level diagram of the ds1clp processor implemented with Infinite Linear Oversampling and anti-warping.

== Testing the effect

Now that we have built the effect with FAUST, we can put our effect through a
series of tests to check if it processes audio in the way we expect it to.
